\title{Select Top Individuals from a Population Based on Fitness}
\usage{
selector_v1(pop, number, clf)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{A list representing the population, where each individual has a
`fit_` attribute that represents its fitness score.}

\item{number}{An integer specifying the number of individuals to select from
the sorted population.}

\item{clf}{A classifier object containing any additional parameters needed
for selection (though not directly used in this function).}
}
\value{
A list of the top `number` individuals from the population, sorted by
  fitness.
}
\description{
This function selects a specified number of top individuals from a population
based on their fitness scores. It sorts the population in descending order of
fitness and returns the highest-ranking individuals.
}
\details{
The function sorts the population in descending order by the `fit_`
attribute and returns the top `number` individuals. This selection strategy
prioritizes individuals with the highest fitness scores, making it useful for
selecting elites in evolutionary algorithms.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pop <- list(
  list(fit_ = 0.9, indices_ = 1:5),
  list(fit_ = 0.8, indices_ = 6:10),
  list(fit_ = 0.7, indices_ = 11:15)
)
clf <- list() # Placeholder for classifier settings
selected_individuals <- selector_v1(pop, number = 2, clf)
print(selected_individuals)
