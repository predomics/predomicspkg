\title{Evolve a Population of Models Over Generations}
\usage{
evolve(X, y, clf, pop, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame representing the features of the training dataset.}

\item{y}{A vector representing the target variable for the training dataset.}

\item{clf}{A classifier object containing parameters for the evolutionary algorithm, including:
- `nb_generations`: The number of generations to evolve the population.
- `size_pop`: The target population size.
- `current_sparsity`: The desired sparsity level for individuals.
- `select_type`: Selection method, which can be "elite," "tournoi," or "mixed."
- `select_perc1` and `select_perc2`: Percentages used in mixed selection.
- `mutate_size`: Percentage of the population to mutate in each generation.
- `plot`: Boolean indicating whether to plot the evolution of the best score.
- `convergence`: Boolean indicating if convergence testing should be applied.
- `convergence_steps`: The number of steps used for convergence testing.}

\item{pop}{A list representing the initial population of models, with each individual represented as a vector of selected features.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list representing the final evolved population of models.
}
\description{
This function evolves a population of models across a specified number of generations, using selection, crossover, and mutation operations. It tracks the best-performing individuals in each generation to encourage convergence toward optimal solutions.
}
\details{
The function evolves a population of models over multiple generations using the following steps:
1. **Evaluation**: Evaluates each individual in the population.
2. **Selection**: Selects parents based on specified selection criteria (`select_type`).
3. **Crossover**: Combines genetic material from selected parents to produce children.
4. **Mutation**: Mutates a portion of the population to introduce genetic diversity.
5. **Convergence Testing**: Optionally tests for convergence, stopping the evolution early if stability is detected in performance.
**Population Structure**: The population is a list of vectors, where each vector represents a sparse model (a subset of features). After each generation, the function retains the best-performing individuals, tracking the evolution of the best score across generations.
