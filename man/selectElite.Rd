\title{Select Elite Individuals Based on Evaluation Scores}
\usage{
selectElite(evaluation, percentage)
}
\arguments{
\item{evaluation}{A numeric vector of evaluation scores for each individual
in the population. Higher scores indicate better performance.}

\item{percentage}{A numeric value representing the percentage of the top
individuals to select, specified as a value between 0 and 100.}
}
\value{
A vector of indices representing the top-performing individuals in
  the population.
}
\description{
This function selects the top-performing individuals from a population based
on their evaluation scores. It returns the indices of the highest-scoring
individuals, making up a specified percentage of the total population.
}
\details{
The function calculates the number of individuals to select based on
the given `percentage` and the length of `evaluation`. It then sorts
`evaluation` in descending order and returns the indices of the
top-performing individuals.

This selection method is often used to maintain high-quality solutions
(elites) in evolutionary algorithms, ensuring that the best individuals are
retained across generations.

\examples{
\dontrun{
evaluation <- c(0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5)
elite_indices <- selectElite(evaluation, percentage = 40)
print(elite_indices)  # Returns indices of the top 40\% based on evaluation scores
}
