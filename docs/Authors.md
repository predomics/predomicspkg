# Authors

Predomics was created by:

-   **Edi Prifti**: Edi is the creator and maintainer of the `predomics` approach and package since 2015. He has proposed the genetic algorithm approaches (`TerGa1` and `TerGa2`), the concept of the Family of Best Models, numérous visuzalization tools and lots of other cool ideas.
-   **Jean-Daniel Zucker**: Jean-Daniel has brought numerous founding ideas behind the method since 2015. He has also proposed the beam search heuristic (`TerBeam`) and has co-led the work.
-   **Yann Chevaleyre**: Yann was involved in the initial developments and has worked on the concepts of balances and the mathematical optimization method (`TerDa`).
-   **Blaise Hanczar**: Blaise was also involved in the initial developments and has contributed notably to the selection of the best models and other general ideas behind the framework.
-   **Eugeni Belda**: Eugeni joined the project in 2019 and has brought his contribution in the interpretability of the signatures, notably applied to the human microbiome as well as their visualization. He has also extensively tested the package using a plethora of datasets.
-   **Lucas Robin**: Lucas, joined the project in 2016 as part of a student project and has worked on the implementation of the `TerGa2` algorithm and has brought some code optimization elements.
-   **Shasha Cui**: Shasha also joined the project as part of a student internship in 2017. Her work focused on the concepts of feature importance.
-   **Magali Cousin Thorez**: Magali joined the project in 2019 during her a student internship. Her work focused on the simplification of the classification signatures and their exploration on the context of microbial ecosystems.
-   **Youcef Sklab**: Youcef has co-led with Edi a couple student projects in collaboration with the ![Sup Galilée engineering school](https://www.sup-galilee.univ-paris13.fr) to build the R Shiny predomicsapp application.
-   **Gaspar Roy**: Gaspar has worked on 2023 on on evolved version of the R shiny application ![predomicsapp](https://predomics.ummisco.ioit).
