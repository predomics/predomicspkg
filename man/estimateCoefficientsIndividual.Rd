\title{Estimate Model Coefficients for a Subset of Features}
\usage{
estimateCoefficientsIndividual(X, y, ind, type = "logit")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame representing the features of the dataset.}

\item{y}{A vector representing the binary target variable for the dataset.}

\item{ind}{A vector of feature indices specifying the subset of features to
include in the model.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of model to fit.
Currently, only `"logit"` (logistic regression) is supported.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `coefs`: A named vector of estimated coefficients for each feature in `ind`.
  - `aic`: The AIC value for the fitted logistic model, indicating model fit.
  - `glm`: The fitted `glm` object.
}
\description{
This function estimates coefficients for a logistic regression model
(`logit`) on a subset of features specified by `ind`. It evaluates the
individual modelâ€™s performance by calculating the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) and returns the coefficients.
}
\details{
The function fits a logistic regression model using the features
specified in `ind`. If `ind` contains a single feature, the function formats
`X` accordingly. It then calculates the coefficients for each feature and the
AIC of the model, providing insights into model performance.

**Note**: Currently, only `"logit"` models are supported. Other types will result in an error message.

\examples{
\dontrun{
X <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
y <- sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)
ind <- c(1, 2, 3)  # Example subset of feature indices
result <- estimateCoefficientsIndividual(X, y, ind, type = "logit")
print(result$coefs)  # Estimated coefficients
print(result$aic)    # AIC of the model
}
