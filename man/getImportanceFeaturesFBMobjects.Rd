\usage{
getImportanceFeaturesFBMobjects(
  clf_res,
  X,
  y,
  verbose = TRUE,
  filter.cv.prev = 0.25,
  scaled.importance = FALSE,
  k_penalty = 0.75/100,
  k_max = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clf_res}{A classifier experiment result, as produced by the modeling
function.}

\item{X}{A feature matrix with rows representing features and columns
representing samples.}

\item{y}{A response variable, either a binary factor (for classification) or
a continuous variable (for regression).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, print detailed messages.}

\item{filter.cv.prev}{Numeric threshold for filtering based on
cross-validation prevalence (default is 0.25).}

\item{scaled.importance}{Logical. If `TRUE`, scales the feature importance
scores.}

\item{k_penalty}{A numeric penalty factor applied to sparsity selection
during model evaluation (default is `0.75/100`).}

\item{k_max}{Maximum allowed sparsity value during model selection (default
is 0).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
  - `featprevFBM`: A data frame containing feature prevalence data.
  - `featImp`: A summary of feature importance across cross-validation folds.
  - `effectSizes`: A data frame with effect sizes for each feature (Cliffâ€™s delta for classification or Spearman's rho for regression).
  - `featPrevGroups`: Data used for plotting feature prevalence by group.
}
\description{
This function processes the final population of models from a given
classifier experiment (`clf_res`), selects the best population based on
specified criteria, and computes the feature importance, prevalence, and
effect sizes. The function returns a list of objects that can be used for
plotting or further analysis of the most relevant features in the model.
}
\details{
**Workflow**:
  - Determines if the experiment is regression or classification based on the classifier's objective.
  - Filters the best models from the population based on sparsity and evaluation criteria.
  - Constructs data structures that capture the feature importance, prevalence, and effect sizes.
  - Returns a list of data objects for easy plotting or further analysis.

**Requirements**:
  - `isExperiment` should be a function that checks if `clf_res` is a valid experiment.
  - `modelCollectionToPopulation`, `selectBestPopulation`, and other helper functions should be defined for processing population and feature data.
