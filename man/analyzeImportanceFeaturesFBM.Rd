\title{Analyze and Plot Feature Importance for Feature-Based Models (FBM)}
\usage{
analyzeImportanceFeaturesFBM(
  clf_res,
  X,
  y,
  makeplot = TRUE,
  saveplotobj = TRUE,
  name = "",
  verbose = TRUE,
  pdf.dims = c(width = 25, height = 20),
  filter.cv.prev = 0.25,
  nb.top.features = 100,

  k_penalty = 0.75/100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{clf_res}{A classifier result object or a list of classifier results.
Each classifier result must contain the trained models and the classifier
parameters.}

\item{X}{The feature matrix.}

\item{y}{The response variable.}

\item{makeplot}{Logical, if `TRUE` (default), plots will be generated and
displayed.}

\item{saveplotobj}{Logical, if `TRUE` (default), the plot objects will be
saved as an RData file.}

\item{name}{A character string for the output file name prefix.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if `TRUE` (default), progress messages are printed.}

\item{pdf.dims}{A numeric vector specifying the width and height of the PDF
output.}

\item{filter.cv.prev}{Numeric, a cutoff for the cross-validation prevalence
filter.}

\item{nb.top.features}{Numeric, the number of top features to display.}

\item{scaled.importance}{Logical, if `TRUE`, scales feature importance
values.}

\item{k_penalty}{Numeric, a penalty factor applied to control model selection
based on sparsity.}

\item{k_max}{Numeric, maximum number of features to include.}
}
\value{
If `makeplot` is `TRUE`, a combined plot of feature importance,
  prevalence, and effect sizes is returned. Otherwise, a list of individual
  plot objects.
}
\description{
This function analyzes and visualizes feature importance for FBM models,
creating plots for feature prevalence, importance, and effect size. It
supports both single and multiple experiments, handling classification and
regression modes.
}
\details{
This function examines the FBM classifier results, retrieves the
best population of models, calculates feature importance, and generates plots
to visualize feature prevalence, importance, and effect size. If multiple
experiments are provided, results are averaged across experiments.

**Generated Plots**:
  - **Feature Prevalence (FBM)**: Shows the frequency and orientation of features across models.
  - **Feature Importance**: Visualizes feature importance scores.
  - **Effect Sizes**: Displays the effect sizes of features.

For classification, Cliff's delta is used for effect sizes, and Spearman's
rho is used for regression.
