\usage{
analyzePopulationFeatures(
  pop,
  X,
  y,

\arguments{
\item{pop}{A population of models, typically obtained from
`modelCollectionToPopulation` or similar functions.}

\item{X}{The data matrix containing features (rows represent features,
columns represent samples).}

\item{y}{The response variable (class labels or continuous values depending
on the model).}

\item{res_clf}{The classifier used for the analysis, typically a result from
a classification experiment.}

\item{makeplot}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the function generates plots and saves
them as a PDF. If `FALSE`, it returns the analysis results without
plotting.}

\item{name}{A string representing the name of the analysis or output (used
for saving files).}

\item{ord.feat}{A string indicating the ordering method for features. Options
are:
- "prevalence": Order by the prevalence of features across models.
- "importance": Order by feature importance based on cross-validation.
- "hierarchical": Order by hierarchical clustering of the feature-to-model coefficient matrix.}

\item{make.network}{Logical. If `TRUE`, generates a network of feature
co-occurrence across the population of models.}

\item{network.layout}{A string indicating the layout of the network. Default
is "circular". Other options may include "fr" for Fruchterman-Reingold
layout.}

\item{network.alpha}{A numeric value controlling the alpha transparency of
the network plot.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prints additional information during
execution.}

\item{pdf.dims}{A vector of two numbers specifying the width and height of
the PDF output (in inches).}

\item{filter.perc}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the minimum
prevalence of a feature to be included in the analysis.}

\item{k_penalty}{A penalty value for model selection in the population
filtering.}

\item{k_max}{The maximum number of models to include in the final population
after filtering.}
}
\value{
If `makeplot = TRUE`, returns a PDF with visualizations of feature
  importance, prevalence, and model coefficients. If `makeplot = FALSE`,
  returns a list of the analysis results including the normalized scores and
  feature importance.

\description{
This function analyzes features in a population of models, allowing for the
visualization and examination of feature importance, prevalence, and model
coefficients. It can generate a variety of plots to understand the
distribution and importance of features in the given population.
}
\details{
The function performs a variety of analyses on a population of
models:
- It filters models based on feature prevalence.
- It orders features by various metrics such as prevalence, importance, or hierarchical clustering.
- It generates plots of feature prevalence, model coefficients, and other characteristics.
- If requested, it also generates a network of feature co-occurrence across the models.

# Assuming 'pop' is a valid population of models, 'X' is the feature matrix, and 'y' is the response variable
