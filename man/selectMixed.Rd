\title{Select Individuals Using Mixed Elite and Tournament Selection}
\usage{
selectMixed(evaluation, percentage_elite, percentage_tournoi)
}
\arguments{
\item{evaluation}{A numeric vector of evaluation scores for each individual
in the population, with higher values indicating better performance.}

\item{percentage_elite}{A numeric value representing the percentage of
individuals to select based on elite selection (top performers).}

\item{percentage_tournoi}{A numeric value representing the percentage of
individuals to select based on tournament selection (random selection).}
}
\value{
A vector of indices representing the selected individuals, combining
  elite and tournament selections.
}
\description{
This function combines elite selection and tournament selection to select
individuals from a population. It first selects a specified percentage of
top-performing individuals (elite) and then fills the remaining percentage
with randomly selected individuals (tournament).
}
\details{
The function calculates the total number of individuals to select
(`perc`) based on `percentage_elite` and `percentage_tournoi`. It then uses
`selectElite` to select the top-performing individuals as elites, filling
`perc_elite` slots. Afterward, it uses `selectTournoi` to fill the remaining
`perc_tournoi` slots by selecting randomly from the remaining individuals.

This mixed selection approach ensures that high-quality solutions are
retained while also introducing diversity through random selection.
