\title{Plot AUC and ROC Curve with Confidence Intervals}
\usage{
plotAUC(score, y, main = "", ci = TRUE, percent = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{score}{A numeric vector containing the predicted scores from the model.}

\item{y}{A numeric or factor vector containing the true class labels. The
labels should be binary, with two levels (e.g., 1 and -1, or 0 and 1).}

\item{main}{A string representing the title of the plot. Default is an empty
string.}

\item{ci}{A logical value indicating whether to compute and display the
confidence intervals for the AUC. Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{percent}{A logical value indicating whether to express the ROC curve in
percentage scale. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A `roc` object from the `pROC` package, containing the ROC curve and
  AUC information.
}
\description{
This function generates a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and
computes the Area Under the Curve (AUC) along with the corresponding
confidence intervals. It also highlights the best threshold using Youden's
index.
}
\details{
The function uses the `pROC` package to compute and plot the ROC
curve and AUC. The best threshold is determined using Youdenâ€™s index, and it
is displayed on the plot with vertical and horizontal lines. The plot
includes the AUC value and its confidence intervals, as well as the best
threshold on the curve.

# Assuming `score` is a vector of predicted scores and `y` is the true labels
plotAUC(score, y, main = "ROC Curve with AUC", ci = TRUE)
}
