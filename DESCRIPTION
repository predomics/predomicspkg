Description: The predomics package offers access to a novel framework implementing several heuristics that allow to find 
    sparse and interpretable models in large datasets. These models are efficient and adopted for 
    classification and regression in metagenomics and other commensurable datasets. We introduce the BTR (BIN, TER, RATIO) 
    languages that describe different types of associations between variables. Moreover, in the same framework we implemented several 
    state-of-the-art methods (SOTA) including RF, ENET and SVM.
