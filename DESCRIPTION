Description: The predomics package offers access to a novel framework implementing several heuristics that allow finding
    sparse and interpretable models in large datasets. These models are efficient and adopted for classification and regression 
    in metagenomics and other commensurable datasets. We introduce the BTR (BIN, TER, RATIO) languages that describe different 
    types of associations between variables. Moreover, in the same framework we implemented several state-of-the-art methods 
    (SOTA) including RF, ENET and SVM.
