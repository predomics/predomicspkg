\title{Compute Effect Sizes for Features}
\usage{
computeEffectSizes(X, y, mode)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A feature matrix with rows representing features and columns
representing samples.}

\item{y}{The response variable, either a binary factor for classification
(with levels `1` and `-1`) or a continuous variable for regression.}

\item{mode}{A character string indicating the task type, either
`"classification"` or `"regression"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with effect size metrics for each feature:
  - For `classification` mode: columns `feature`, `cdelta` (Cliff's delta), and `pval.wilcox` (p-value from Wilcoxon test).
  - For `regression` mode: columns `feature`, `rho` (Spearman's correlation coefficient), and `pval` (p-value).
}
\description{
This function computes effect sizes for each feature in the feature matrix
`X`, using different methods based on the specified mode (`classification` or
`regression`). For classification tasks, it calculates Cliff's delta and
performs a Wilcoxon test for each feature, assuming binary classes `1` and
`-1`. For regression tasks, it computes Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient.
}
\details{
**Classification Mode**:
  - Checks that `y` contains only binary values (`1` and `-1`).
  - Calculates Cliff's delta to measure effect size and performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess the significance of feature values between the two classes.

**Regression Mode**:
  - Computes Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (`rho`) to assess monotonic relationships between each feature and the continuous response variable `y`.
