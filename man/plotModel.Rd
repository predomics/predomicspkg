  sort.features = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A model object (e.g., a fitted machine learning model such as SVM,
logistic regression, or random forest).}

\item{X}{A data matrix or data frame where each row is an observation and
each column is a feature.}

\item{y}{A vector of class labels (e.g., 1 and -1 for binary classification,
or continuous for regression) corresponding to the rows in `X`.}

\item{sort.features}{Logical; if `TRUE`, the features will be sorted by their
discriminance with respect to `y`. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{sort.ind}{A vector of indices for sorting the features. If `NULL`, the
function will determine the order based on discriminance. Default is
`NULL`.}

\item{feature.name}{Logical; if `TRUE`, the feature names will be displayed
on the plot.}

\item{col.sign}{A vector of two colors for positive and negative coefficients
(default is `c("deepskyblue1", "firebrick1")`).}

\item{main}{A string for the title of the plot.}

\item{slim}{Logical; if `TRUE`, the plot will be simplified (e.g., removing
axis labels and ticks). Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{importance}{Logical; if `TRUE`, the feature importance will be plotted.
Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{res_clf}{Optional; a result object containing cross-validation or
feature importance data. This is used when `importance` is `TRUE` for
models that have a cross-validation feature.}
}
\value{
If the model is a `Random Forest`, the function returns a decision
tree plot. For other models, it returns a `ggplot` object showing the feature
coefficients or importance.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the coefficients of a model, with the option to plot
feature importance. It supports various model types, including SOTA models
and Random Forests, and can display the results in a variety of layouts,
including plots of feature coefficients, feature importance, or decision
trees.
}
\details{
This function generates a plot of model coefficients or feature
importance, depending on the model type and the `importance` parameter. The
function supports SOTA models (like SVM or logistic regression), where
coefficients are visualized, and Random Forest models, where decision trees
can be plotted. The plot can also include feature importance, if available.

If the model is a `Random Forest`, the function will plot a decision tree.
For other models, it will plot the feature coefficients with color-coded bars
for positive and negative coefficients.

\examples{
# Example usage for a classification model
model <- train(logistic_regression_model)  # Assume this is a pre-trained model
X <- data.frame(feature1 = rnorm(100), feature2 = rnorm(100))
y <- sample(c(1, -1), 100, replace = TRUE)

# Plot the model's coefficients
plotModel(model, X, y, main = "Model Coefficients Plot")

# Plot the model's importance (if available)
plotModel(model, X, y, importance = TRUE)
